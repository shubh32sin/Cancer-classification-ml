# Cancer-classification-ml
In this project, different machine learning algorithms are trained and tested on the Wisconsin Breast Cancer datasets like Linear Regression, Random Forest, SVM and k-NN.The [data](https://github.com/shubh32sin/Cancer-classification-ml/blob/master/data.csv) is based on binary classification of cancer being either benign or malignant depending upon 30+ features.The features considered for training data were selected by pre processing data by heatmap. ![img](https://github.com/shubh32sin/Cancer-classification-ml/blob/master/images/hmap.png) The main objective is to assess the correctness in classifying data with respect to accuracy and efficiency of each algorithm.
